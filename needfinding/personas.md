# Microsoft Teams AI Assistant Personas

### Persona 1: The Overwhelmed Student
**Profile:**  
First-year student still getting used to juggling college work. Uses Teams because professors require it, but doesn’t really like it. Everything feels spread out. They constantly switch between Outlook, Teams, Moodle, and random tabs just to find one file.  

**Pain Points:**  
They waste time every day opening different places just to remember what needs to be done. Sometimes they forget where instructions came from or which version of a file is the right one. They feel like their energy goes to organizing instead of actually working.  

**AI Needs:**  
They want an assistant that just knows where everything is. If they type or say a keyword like “reflection paper,” it should find the document, pull up the instructions, and open it ready to edit. They don’t want to think about navigation at all.  

**Ideal Experience:**  
They open their laptop, ask the AI for the next assignment due, and it brings up exactly what they need, maybe even a small summary of what it’s about.

### Persona 2: The Focused Upperclassman
**Profile:**  
Junior computer science major who likes structure. Uses Teams for project coordination and classes, but also runs into issues when trying to connect work between Microsoft and Google tools.  

**Pain Points:**  
Frustrated that Teams and Outlook feel disconnected from the rest of their workflow. They have a system for planning tasks in Notion and setting reminders in Google Calendar, but nothing syncs. That leads to small mistakes like missing a message or forgetting a deadline.  

**AI Needs:**  
They want something that bridges systems. If the AI could notice tasks mentioned in emails or chats and automatically sync them with their planner or calendar, that would solve most of their issues.  

**Ideal Experience:**  
They get one daily summary that lists what’s due, what’s unread, and what’s upcoming, and everything links straight to the right files. No need to bounce between five different tabs.

### Persona 3: The Teaching Assistant Who Multitasks
**Profile:**  
Senior TA working in two departments. Uses Teams for lab coordination, student communication, and file sharing. Also answers questions from students at random hours.  

**Pain Points:**  
Teams messages pile up quickly, and it’s hard to keep track of who needs a reply or which version of a file was finalized. They also waste time searching through chats for links or attachments.  

**AI Needs:**  
Wants an assistant that can summarize unread messages, pull out action items, and show them what needs to be done first. They also want automatic calendar updates when meetings are mentioned in chat.  

**Ideal Experience:**  
They open Teams and immediately see a short checklist of what’s pending. The AI highlights messages that still need replies and links every task to its file or calendar event. They can get through everything without searching.
